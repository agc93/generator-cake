## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-cake using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-cake
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo cake
```

or to generate only certain scripts:

```bash
yo cake:config
yo cake:bootstrapper
```

### Frosting

You can use our (experimental) generator for [Frosting](https://github.com/cake-build/frosting) to quickly setup a new project:

```bash
yo cake:frosting
```
